# ReadStagYY

Please find here routines for MATLAB or OCTAVE, to read and process binary data files produced by the StagYY convection code (Tackley, Physics of the Earth and Planetary interiors, 2008). The routines are appropriate to 3D spherical geometry.
They were successively built by Boris Kaus (University of Mainz), Paul Tackley (E.T.H. Zurich), Tobias Rolf (CEED Olso) and Nicolas Coltice (University of Lyon).
